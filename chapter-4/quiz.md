1. When is an experiment considered reliable?
> if someone else can repeat the experiment and find the same conclusion

2. Which type of regression analysis is often used to model variables that have an exponential relationship?
> nonlinear

3. In a linear regression, which variable is also known as the target or response variable?
> dependent

4. Which type of machine learning algorithm uses data sets verified by experts as its learning basis?
> supervised

5. When a number of items are grouped together, which type of machine learning algorithm can determine which items in the group predict the presence of other items?
> association

6. If the results of a study do not align with previous studies, what question should an evaluator ask?
> Can the study be replicated to verify the findings?

7. What is the most commonly used statistical method for analyzing data?
> regression analysis

8. What is the goal of linear regression?
> to compute a line the interpolates the data, and which can be expressed as a weighted average of the predictor variables and any other function

9. When you follow the scientific method, which step would occur after testing the hypotheses through experimentation?
